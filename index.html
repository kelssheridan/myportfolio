            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
     
            <p>Welcome to my digital portfolio! My name is Kelsey Sheridan and I'm a Literature, Media, and Communications major at Georgia Tech with a passion for visual design. I’m choosing to concentrate on the threads of <b>Interaction Design</b> and <b>Communications</b> for my major.</p>

            <p>I’ve been creating work and smearing paint and doodling over notebooks since my mom stuck a crayon in my hands when I was two. I hope to be able to translate my childhood dreams and ambitions into a real-world, successful career by transitioning the sketches of paper dolls into sketches of sophisticated designs and by transitioning snapshots of flowers growing by a sidewalk into professional shots for ad campaigns.</p>
        
            <p>I hope you enjoy exploring my website and following along on the unique journey each of these projects took me!</p>
