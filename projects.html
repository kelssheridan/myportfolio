        <h2>MY PROJECTS</h2>
        <p>This page is only a sample of my previous visual design work. Almost all of these projects required brainstorming ideas and many iterations to create the final pieces seen below, but I have only included the final compositions and my thoughts on the intentional processes behind them. Keep scrolling to view a few of my completed projects!</p>

        <h3>Logo Branding</h3>
        
        <p>Branding yourself is difficult. You’re finalizing the way you want to be perceived and understood by the general public, so when thinking of a logo to brand my own style, it took a couple experiments to find the right expression for myself.</p>
                
        <img src="logo.png" alt="Headshot of Me" width=".001" height="525" class="center">
        
        <p>I knew beginning this project that I wanted my logotype text to be natural and flowing because I see myself and my brand as gentle and comforting. For this purpose, the final logotype has consistent, smooth curves and natural bends, but I chose to control the stroke more because I wanted to keep an appearance of professionalism and control.</p>
        
        <p>I also wanted to unify the design in some manner to give it a complete and whole feeling, which is why I designed the logotype within a circular area. The final design is enclosed within an elliptical area almost reminiscent of the shape of a light bulb, with my initials representing the filaments inside, beaming light. This metaphor is correlates with the ingenuity and creativity and light my brand represents. Because I also believe my brand aesthetics to be softer and more gentle, I chose a calming shade of blue that is still strong enough on its own to catch the eye of the viewer. My brand is a natural, painterly one, and I believe the choices for my logotype design reflect that.</p>

        <h3>Digital Collage</h3>
                
        <p>My initial inspiration for this project was simply the color light pink. I have been drawn to this color over and over again as it continually pops up in my life. I find it interesting that the same square of color on a paint swatch can be found in various samples of items and categories from everyday life in identical shades. Whether the color is in textured fabric or the pigments of my skin or the petals on a flower or Valentine’s Day candy hearts, whether natural or man-made, it can be found everywhere.</p>

        <p>For this project, I complied a collage of these samples, a collage of daily life sampled from pink. My intent was to define and represent the color “millennial pink” for me based on my interpretation of it and by the objects I see around me. Because I associate this color with soft, light aesthetics, I chose to keep the composition uncluttered with a muted color palette and neat, thin outlined drawings. I made the main focal point the paint swatch color itself in the center because that is the essence of the piece. The color I chose may be represented differently to others based on their own perspectives, but the way I chose to define the pink is based off my own collaged experiences.</p>

        <h3>Speculative Future Posters</h3>
        
        <p>Imagine a future world where the oceans no longer sparkled green and blue in the sun’s golden rays. A world where the groundwater is clogged with plastics and pollutants which have leaked their way into the ocean. The speculative future in this poster design is based off the frightening reality of the amount of pollution escalating in our oceans and groundwater by chemical runoff and non-degradable plastics in the year 2045. Because the oceans have become so toxic, sea turtles, which were already endangered, had nothing left to eat except the plastic we threw there. They are now extinct. If we don’t start cleaning up our oceans, the marine life and seafood itself will cease to exist and all we’ll have left from the sea to eat is our own plastic trash. Things are bad, to say the least.</p>
        
        <img src="Dinner Time.png" alt="Speculative Future Chemical Cocktail" width="150" height="600" class="center">
                
        <p>I chose to incorporate a soft pastel color scheme because it contrasts so strongly with the blunt and provocative themes the campaign is promoting. The font choice of a bold, sans-serif text relates a no-nonsense tone that gets right to the point. The iconic images are easy for the general public to interpret and understand, which is vital for the purpose of the campaign to raise awareness. The nonprofit organization, W.A.T.E.R. (World Awareness for Treatment of the Earth and Reclamation), seeks to bring awareness to the dangers of chemical runoff and non-degradable plastics, so I chose a simplistic logo depicting a clean, light blue wave. I also collaborated with a partner for this campaign series.</p>
